# Vending-Machine-App

## Project Description
The app functions under the same principles as an ordinary vending machine. Rather than providing the user with food, it gives them a receipt with the contents of their purchase and the price.
There is limited stock for the items inside the vending machine. The user cannot buy an infinite amount of items. Once the stock runs out they will be unable to buy any more. Stock is determined by a csv file. This file also contains the names and codes of the products. Whenever a product is bought, the csv file is modified to reflect the reduction in stock.
While most real vending machines only allow their user to buy a single item at once, our virtual vending machine allows users to purchase multiple items at once. Of course, they can also only buy a single item if they so wish
Since the virtual vending machine can’t spit out real food and the user still has to know if the purchase worked we implemented a receipt system. After checking out a receipt pop-up appears on the user’s screen providing them with a breakdown of their purchase.

## Development Approach
We chose to develop this virtual vending machine behave like a regular vending machine with a keypad, a display of snacks, a limited number of snacks, and it had to have a way to show the user what they had purchased. After having discussed all requirements we immediately got to work. The app had to take a user input, that being a code, and provide the user with a receipt as well as modify a csv file to represent the remaining stock.
